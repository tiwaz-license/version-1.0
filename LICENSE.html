    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>

    </p>
    <h3 id="2-4-representation">2.4. Representation</h3>

    <h3 id="2-5-fair-use">2.5. Fair Use</h3>

    <h3 id="3-1-distribution-of-source-form">
      3.1. Distribution of Source Form
    </h3>
    <p>
      All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
      Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
      the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code
      Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and
      how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter
      or restrict the recipients&#39; rights in the Source Code Form.
    </p>
    <h3 id="3-2-distribution-of-executable-form">
      3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
    </h3>
    <p>If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,
          as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the
          Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
          reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost
          of distribution to the recipient; and
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
          License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
          license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the
          recipients&#39; rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3 id="3-3-distribution-of-a-larger-work">
      3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

      provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
      the Covered Software.
    </p>
    <h3 id="3-4-notices">3.4. Notices</h3>
    <p>
      You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices

      limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the
      Covered Software.
    </p>
    <h3 id="3-5-application-of-additional-terms">
      3.5. Application of Additional Terms
    </h3>
    <p>
      You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
      indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
      Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
      behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such
      warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You
      alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
      liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
      indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
      disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
      jurisdiction.

      4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
    </h2>
    <p>
      If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
      License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
      statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible;
          and
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>describe the limitations and the code they affect.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Such description must be placed in a text file included with all
      distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the
      extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
      sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
      understand it.
    </p>
    <h2 id="5-termination">5. Termination</h2>
    <p>
      5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if
      You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
      compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
      Contributor are reinstated
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and
          finally terminates Your grants, and
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
          non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You
          have come back into compliance.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an
      ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by
      some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of
      non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become
      compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
      infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
      counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
      directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
      You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1
      of this License shall terminate.
    </p>
    <p>
      5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end
      user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have
      been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior
      to termination shall survive termination.
    </p>
    <h2 id="6-disclaimer-of-warranty">6. Disclaimer of Warranty</h2>
    <blockquote style="background-color: rgb(250, 250, 142);">
      <p>
        Covered Software is provided under this License on an &quot;as is&quot;
        basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or
        statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered
        Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose
        or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of
        the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove
        defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of
        any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of
        warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any
        Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this
        disclaimer.

    <h2 id="7-limitation-of-liability">7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <blockquote style="background-color: rgb(250, 250, 142);">
      <p>
        Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort
        (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor,
        or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable
        to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential
        damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost
        profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or
        malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if
        such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages.
        This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or
        personal injury resulting from such party&#39;s negligence to the extent
        applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not
        allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential
        damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <h2 id="8-litigation">8. Litigation</h2>
    <p>
      Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts
      of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of
      business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
      jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing
      in this Section shall prevent a party&#39;s ability to bring cross-claims
      or counter-claims.
    </p>
    <h2 id="9-miscellaneous">9. Miscellaneous</h2>
    <p>
      This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
      matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
      unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
      necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
      that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
      shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.
