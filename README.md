# Tiwaz License, version 1.0

> This version of the License is not final. Do not use it. The final and official version will be released in the `final` branch when the OSI approves it.

## About The License

The Tiwaz License, version 1.0 is a free and open-source software license. It is a "file-level" or "weak copyleft" license, similar in structure and intent to licenses like the Mozilla Public License 2.0. This means that while modifications to files covered by the Tiwaz License must themselves be licensed under the Tiwaz License, the license permits combining the Covered Software with other software (a "Larger Work") under different licenses, as long as the requirements for the Tiwaz-licensed portions are met.

The license aims to provide a balance between encouraging sharing and modification of the core software while allowing flexibility for integration into broader projects.

## Key Features & Goals

* **Version Immutability:** This is a core principle of the Tiwaz License. Software licensed under "Tiwaz License, version 1.0" **must** always be distributed under version 1.0. There is no "or-later" clause permitting distribution under subsequent versions of the Tiwaz License that might be published by the license steward (Section 10.2). This ensures that the terms under which software is received remain constant and predictable.
* **File-Level Copyleft:** Modifications to files covered by the Tiwaz License must be made available under the terms of the Tiwaz License (Section 3.1).
* **Patent Grant & Defensive Clause:** The license includes an explicit grant of patent rights from contributors for their contributions (Section 2.1) and a defensive termination clause to discourage patent aggression (Section 5.2).
* **Clarity:** The license strives for clarity in its terms and conditions.
* **Permissive for Larger Works:** You can combine Tiwaz-licensed software with other code under different licenses to create a "Larger Work," provided the Tiwaz-licensed components continue to meet the Tiwaz License requirements (Section 3.3).
* **No Secondary License Compatibility Mechanism:** Unlike MPL 2.0, the Tiwaz License 1.0 does not include an explicit mechanism for relicensing Covered Software under "Secondary Licenses" (such as the GNU GPL family). Covered Software remains solely under the terms of the Tiwaz License.

## Relationship to Mozilla Public License 2.0

The Tiwaz License, version 1.0 shares a significant structural and textual heritage with the Mozilla Public License, version 2.0 (MPL 2.0). Many of its clauses concerning definitions, grants, responsibilities, and disclaimers are similar. However, the Tiwaz License, version 1.0 has key differences:

* **Strict Version Immutability:** As detailed above, software licensed under Tiwaz 1.0 cannot be distributed under later versions of the Tiwaz License. MPL 2.0 allows distribution under the original version or any later version published by the steward.
* **No "Secondary License" Mechanism:** MPL 2.0 includes provisions for compatibility with certain GNU licenses (Secondary Licenses). The Tiwaz License 1.0 omits this mechanism.
* **Minor Differences:** Such as the handling of alterations to license notices.
